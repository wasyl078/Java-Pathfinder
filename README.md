# :heart: Java-Pathfinder ![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/mit/mit.svg?v=102) ![my badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-beta_version-red)
This is Java verison of **Python-Pathfiner**, but this is the original project and my first implementation. I focused on implementing sophisticated graph's and tree's algorithms. This is real example how to use in "real live" those algorithms. This project is Bomberman-like - so you move in maze, place bombs and try not to be cought by enemy evil squere, who alweays know where you are (thanks to algorithms :heart:)

## Technologies and algorithms 
I used Java 8 with JavaFX library. 

Algorithms implemented: 
- A* - algorithm used to find the shortest path in the maze
- Prim's algorithm - minimal spanding tree algorithm - used to generate maze

## How to play
Use keyboard keys to move :arrow_up::arrow_down::arrow_left::arrow_right:
Use key "X" to place bombs
Use key "Z" to make close-triangle attack
